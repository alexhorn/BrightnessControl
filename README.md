You can configure autostart and hotkeys using the settings accessibly via the system tray icon context menu. By default, you can use Alt + Add and Alt + Subtract to change your monitor's brightness settings. Alternatively, you can click on the system tray icon to open the brightness overlay.

## System requirements
* Windows Vista or newer (Windows 10 works just fine)
* .NET Framework 4.5.2 or newer
* For development: Visual Studio 2015 or newer
